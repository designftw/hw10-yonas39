      <h1>User Testing on Figma Prototype</h1>

      <!-- Write Introduction here -->
      <article class="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This user testing exercise aimed to assess the usability and efficacy
          of three distinct design concepts for a chat/messaging application. To
          achieve this, I asked multiple users to engage with the designs while
          I monitored their interactions and provided assistance where
          necessary. I will use the information gathered from this user testing
          to enhance the app's design and functionality.

      <article>
        <h3>Design 1: Long press</h3>
        <p>
          In this task, I wanted to test how easy it is for the user to
          translate an incoming message from a foreign language to a language of
          their choice using the long press option. I wanted to see if users
          found the long press option intuitive and easy to use and could select
          the language they wanted to translate from the options list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some users initially needed clarification about the selection method
          during the user testing session. I observed the long press option was
          not intuitive for all users. I discovered that some users prefer to
          see a language dropdown instead of a long-press option menu.
          Meanwhile, users familiar with the long press option successfully
          translate the incoming message after a few attempts.

      <!-- here write about design_2 test  -->
      <article>
        <h3>Design-2: Users Choose a Language Preference in the Setting</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of this task was to test how easy it is for users to set
          up their language preferences in the app settings. Once users set
          their preferences in the setting, the app will translate all incoming
          messages to their preferred language. I aimed to determine whether
          users found the language preference setting intuitive and easy to
          navigate and whether the app would translate incoming messages
          according to user preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I discovered from the user testing session that some users find the
          settings and locating the language preferences easier, except for some
          vague labels of language setting terminologies. I plan to redefine the
          settings labels to make them more user-friendly and intuitive. Most
          users could locate the language preference setting, successfully set
          up their language preferences, and test the translation feature.
          Additionally, users found the detected language option helpful,
          allowing them to see the language of the incoming message, despite its
          confusing labeling. Based on the users' feedback, I plan to Improve
          labeling and make it more intuitive than it currently is.

        <h3>
          Design-3: Translate Incoming and Outgoing Message Using Drop Down Menu
        </h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to test how easy it is for the user to translate an incoming
          and outgoing message from their preferred language to a foreign
          language using the dropdown option next to the text input box. I
          wanted to see if users found the dropdown option convenient and easy
          to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the user testing session, I observe Users found the dropdown
          option convenient and easy to use. However, some users needed
          clarification about how the language detection feature worked. I plan
          to add a tooltip or help feature to explain the language detection
          feature. Users who could select the language they wanted to translate
          to could translate their outgoing and incoming messages successfully.

      <!-- space for user insight and plans for change -->
      <article>
        <h2>Insights and Plans for Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Overall, users preferred Design 2 over the other two designs, allowing
          them to set their language preferences once and have all incoming
          messages automatically translated into their preferred language.
          However, users also found Design 3 convenient for translating incoming
          messages and outgoing messages into prefered language and a foreign
          language respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the user testing insights, I plan to make the following
          changes on the design and functionality of the app:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Redesign the settings page to make it more readable, easier to
            understand, user-friendly and intuitive. I also plan to add a
            shortcut to the language preferences on the main screen for easier
            access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a search feature to the list of options in the dropdown menu for
            easier navigation and selection of languages and also improve
            efficiency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a tooltip or help feature to explain the language detection
            feature to users who may be unfamiliar with it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Redesign the long press option to include a language dropdown
            instead of a list of options to make it more intuitive and
            user-friendly.(I may drop this option as its less prefered by the
            users)
          </li>
        </ul>
