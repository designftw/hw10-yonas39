    <h1>Usability Issues</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Identifying and improving potential usability Issues is very important
        and impact the user's ability to use the chat app effectively. I have
        used Nielsen's heuristics as a guideline to evaluate the chat app's
        usability. I will present my findings and recommend solutions for the
        issues I have identified below.
